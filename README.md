# Decker Initializer

Adds the functionality to create decker project templates from the explorer context menu.

## Features

Right click on a directory in the explorer to create files from templates. A quick pick will appear to choose the template from. Allows configuration of the templates by user input.

## Requirements

None for this extension in particular but a decker installation is recommended to actually make use of the files.

The decker-edu.decker-server extension is also recommended.

## Extension Settings

None at the moment, but upcoming configuration will allow for the addition of other template files.

## Known Issues

Untested.

## Release Notes

No official release yet. This is purely here to serve as a test bed for the decker-edu.decker-pack extension pack.
